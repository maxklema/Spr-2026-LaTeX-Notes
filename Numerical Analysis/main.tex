\section{Lecture 1 - Important Ideas from Calculus I}

\vspace{11pt}
\subsection{Continuity}
In this section, we will see that the mathematical definition of continuity corresponds closely with the meaning of the word continuity in every day language.

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Continuity:} A continuous process is one that takes place gradually - without interruption or abrupt change.

A function $f$ is continuous at a number $a$ if:

\end{displaymath}

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{aside}
Notice that Definition 1 implicitly requires three things if $f$ is continuous at $a$:

\begin{itemize}
\item $f(a)$ is defined - that is, $a$ is in the domain of $f$.
\item $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists.
\item $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$
\end{itemize}

\end{aside}
\vspace{11pt}

The definition states that $f$ is continuous at $a$ is $f(x)$ approaches $f(a)$ as $x$ approaches $a$. Thus, a continuous function $f$ has the property that a small change in $x$ produces only a small change in $f(x)$. In fact, the change in $f(x)$ can be kept as small as we please by keeping the change in $x$ sufficiently small.

If $f$ is defined near a-that is, $f$ is defined on an open interval containing $a$, except perhaps at $a$-we say that $f$ is discontinuous at $a$ (or $f$ has a discontinuity at $a$) if $f$ is not continuous at $a$.

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{aside}
Geometrically, you can think of a function that is continuous at every number in an interval as a function whose graph as no break in it. The graph can be drawn without removing your pen from the paper.
\end{aside}
\vspace{11pt}

\textbf{Example 1:} The figure shows the graph of a function $f$. At which numbers if $f$ is discontinuous? Why?

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{1.png}    
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

It looks like there is a discontinuity when $a = 1$ because the graph is broken there. The official reason that $f$ is discontinuous at 1 is that $f(1)$ is not defined there.

The graph also has a break when $a = 3$. However, the reason for discontinuity is different. Here, $f(3)$ is defined, but $\lim_{x \to 3}f(x)$ does not exist (because the left and right limits are different). So, $f$ is discontinuous at 3.

What about $a = 5$? Here, $f(5)$ is defined and $\lim_{x \to 5}f(x)$ exists (because the left and right limits are the same). However,  $\lim_{x \to 5}f(x) \neq f(5)$. Therefore, $f$ is discontinuous at 5.

Now, let's see how to detect discontinuities when a function is defined by a formula.

\vspace{11pt}
Where are each of the following functions discontinuous?

\textbf{Example a:}
\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
\begin{displaymath}
    f(x) = \frac{x^2 -x - 2}{x-2}
\end{displaymath}
\vspace{11pt}

Notice that $f(2)$ is not defined. So, $f$ is discontinuous at 2. Later, we will see why $f$ is continuous at all other numbers.

\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

\textbf{Example b:}
\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
    \[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{x^2}, &x \neq 0 \\
    1, & x = 0
\end{cases}
\]
\vspace{11pt}

Here, $f(0) = 1$ is defined. However, $\lim_{x \to 0}f(x) = \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^2}$ does not exist. Therefore, $f$ is discontinuous at 0.

\end{center}

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Example c:}
\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
    \[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
    \frac{x^2-x-2}{x-2}, &x \neq 2 \\
    1, & x = 2
\end{cases}
\]
\vspace{11pt}

Here, $f(2) = 1$ is defined. Additionally,

\begin{displaymath}
    \lim_{x \to 2}f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2}\frac{x^2 - x - 2}{x - 2} = \lim_{x \to 2}\frac{(x-2)(x+1)}{x - 2} = \lim_{x \to 2}(x+1) = 3
\end{displaymath}

However, $\lim_{x \to 2}f(x) \neq f(2)$. Therefore, $f$ is not continuous at 2.

\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

This kind of discontinuity illustrated in parts (a) and (c) is called removable. We could remove the discontinuity by redefining $f$ at just the single number 2. The function $g(x) = x + 1$ is continuous.

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{2.png}    
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}


The discontinuity in part (b) is called an infinite discontinuty

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{3.png}    
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

A function $f$ is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at every number in the interval. If $f$ is defined only on one side of an endpoint of the interval, we understand 'continuous at the endpoint' to mean 'continuous from the right' or 'continuous from the left.'

\vspace{11pt}
\vspace{11pt}
\vspace{11pt}
\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Example 3:} Show that the function $f(x) = 1 - \sqrt{1 - x^2}$ is continuous on the interval [-1, 1].
\vspace{11pt}

If -1 < a < 1, then using the Limit Laws, we have:

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
    $\lim_{x \to a} =  \lim_{x \to a}(1 - \sqrt{1 - x^2})$

    $= 1 - \lim_{x \to a}\sqrt{1-x^2}$

    $=1-\sqrt{\lim_{x\to a}(1-x^2)}$

    $=1-\sqrt{1-a^2}$

    $=f(a)$
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}
Thus, by Definition 1, $f$ is continuous at $a$ if -1 < a < 1. Similar calculations show that $\lim_{x \to -1^+}f(x) = 1= f(-1)$ and $\lim_{x \to 1^{-1}}f(x) = 1 = f(1)$. So, $f$ is continuous from the right at -1 and continuous from the left at 1. Therefore, according to Definition 3, $f$ is continuous on [-1, 1].

The graph of $f$ is sketched in the figure. It is the lower half of the circle $x^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1$.

\vspace{11pt}

\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

Instead of always using Definitions 1, 2, and 3 to verify the continuity of a function, as we did in Example 4, it is often convenient to use the next theorem. It shows how to build up complicated continuous functions from simple ones.

If f and g are continuous at $a$, a $c$ is a constant, then the following functions are also continuous at $a$:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $f + g$
    \item $f - g$
    \item $cf$
    \item $fg$
    \item $\frac{f}{g}$ if $g(a) \neq 0$
\end{itemize}

\vspace{11pt}
The following types of functions are continuous at every number in their domains
\begin{itemize}
    \item Polynomials
    \item Rational functions
    \item Root functions
    \item Trigonometric functions
    \item Inverse trigonometric functions
    \item Exponential functions
    \item Logarithmic functions
\end{itemize}
\vspace{11pt}

An important property of continuous functions is expressed by the following theorem. Its proof is found in more advanced books on calculus.

\vspace{11pt}
\subsection{Intermediate Value Theorem}
Suppose that $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and let $N$ be any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, where $f(a) \neq f(b)$. Then, there exists a number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f(c) = N$.

The theorem states that a continuous function takes on every intermediate value between the function values $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.

The theorem is illustrated by the figure. Note that the value $N$ can be taken on once [as in ($a$)] or more than once [as in ($b$)].

\vspace{11pt}
\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{5.png}    
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

If we think of a continuous function as a function whose graph has no hole or break, then it is easy to believe that the theorem is true.

In geometric terms, it states that, if any horizontal line $y = N$ is given between $y = f(a)$ and $f(b)$ as in the figure, then the graph of $f$ can't jump over the line. It must intersect $y = N$ somewhere.

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{aside}
    It is important that the function in the theorem is continuous. The theorem is not true in general for discontinuous functions.
\end{aside}
\vspace{11pt}

One use of the theorem is in locating roots of equations - as in the following example.

\textbf{Example 10}: Show that there is a root of the equation $4x^3 - 6x^2+3x-2 = 0$ between 1 and 2.

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
Let $f(x) = 4x^3 - 6x^2+3x-2$

We are looking for a solution of the given equation - that is, a number c between 1 and 2 such that $f(c) = 0$.

Therefore, we take $a = 1, b=2,$ and $N=0$ in the theorem.

We have $f(1) = 4 - 6 + 3 -2=-1 < 0$ and $f(2) = 32-24+6-2=12 > 0$

Thus, $f(1) < 0<f(2)$-that is, $N=0$ is a number between $f(1)$ and $f(2)$. Now, $f$ is continuous since it is a polynomial. So, the theorem states that there is such a number $c$ between 1 and 2 such that $f(c) = 0$. In other words, the equation $ 4x^3 - 6x^2+3x-2 = 0$ has at least one root in the interval $(1,2)$.

In fact, we can locate a root more precisely by using the theorem again. Without showing the work, we can see that a root lies in the interval $(1.22, 1.33)$
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

\vspace{11pt}
\subsection{Rolle's Theorem}

Let $f$ be a function that satisfies the following three hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$
    \item $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$
    \item $f(a) = f(b)$
\end{itemize}

Then, there is a number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

Below, the figures show the graphs of four such functions:

\vspace{11pt}
\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{6.png}    
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

In each case, it appears there is at least one point $(c, f(c))$ on the graph where the tangent is horizontal and thus $f'(c) = 0$. So, Rolle's Theorem is plausible.

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Example 1}: Let's apply the theorem to the position function $s = f(t)$ of a moving object.

If the object is in the same place at two different instants $t = a$ and $t = b$, then $f(a) = f(b)$. The theorem states that there is some instant of time $t = c$ between $a$ and $b$ where $f'(c) = 0$; that is, the velocity is 0. In particular, you can see that this is true when a ball is thrown directly upward.

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Example 2}: Prove that the equation $x^3 +x-1=0$ has exactly one real root.

First, we use the Intermediate Value Theorem to show that a root exists. Let $f(x)=x^3+x-1$. Then, $f(0)=-1 < 0$ and $f(1) = 1 > 0$. Since $f$ is a polynomial, it is continuous. So, the theorem states that there is a number $c$ between 0 and 1 such that $f(c) = 0$.

To show that the equation has no other real root, we use Rolle's Theorem and argue by contradiction.

Suppose that it had two roots $a$ and $b$. Then, $f(a) = 0 =f(b)$. As $f$ is a polynomial, it is differentiable on $(a,b)$ and continuous on $[a,b]$. Thus, by Rolle's theorem, there is a number $c$ between $a$ and $b$ such that $f'(c) = 0$. However, $f'(x) = 3x^2 + 1 \geq 1$ for all x (since $x^2 \geq 0$), so $f'(x)$ can never be 0. This gives a contradiction. So, the equation cannot have two real roots.

\vspace{11pt}
\subsection{Mean Value Theorem}

Let $f$ be a function that fulfills two hypotheses:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$.
    \item $f$ is differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$.
\end{itemize}
Then, there is a number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$, or equivalently, $f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)(b-a)$.

\vspace{11pt}
The figures show the points $A(a,f(a))$ and $B(b,f(b))$ on the graphs of two differentiable functions.

\vspace{11pt}
\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{7.png}    
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

The slope of the secant line $AB$ is $m_{AB}=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$. $f'(c)$ is the slope of the tangent line at $(c, f(c))$. So, the Mean Value Theorem - in the form given by Equation 1 - states that there is at least one point $P(c,f(c))$ on the graph whose slope of the tangent line is the same as the slope of the secant line $AB$. In other words, there is a point $P$ where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line $AB$.

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Example 1}: To illustrate the Mean Value Theorem with a specific function, let's consider $f(x) = x^3-x, a=0,b=2$.

Since $f$ is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable for all $x$. So, it is certainly continuous on $[0,2]$ and differentiable on $(0,2)$. Therefore, by the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number $c$ in $(0,2)$ such that: $f(2)-f(0)=f'(c)(2-0)$. 

Now, $f(2) = 6, f(0) = 0,$ and $f'(x) = 3x^2-1$. So, this equation becomes $6 = 2(3c^2-1) = 6c^2-2$. This gives $c^2 = \frac{4}{3}$, that is, $c=\pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$. However, $c$ must lie in $(0,2)$, so $c = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$.

The figure illustrates this calculation. The tangent line at this value of $c$ is parallel to the secant line $OB$.

\vspace{11pt}
\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{8.png}    
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Example 2}: If an object moves in a straight line with position function $s=f(t)$, then the average velocity between $t=a$ and $t=b$ is $\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$. And the velocity at $t=c$ is $f'(c)$.

Thus, the Mean Value Theorem - in the form of Equation 1 - tells us that, at some time $t=c$ between $a$ and $b$, the instantaneous velocity $f'(c)$ is equal to that average velocity. For instance, if a car traveled 180km in 2 hours, the speedometer must have read 90 km/h at least once.

In general, the Mean Value Theorem can be interpreted as saying that there is a number at which the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of change over an interval.

The main significance of the Mean Value Theorem is that it enables us to obtain information about a function from information about its derivative. The next example provides an instance of this principle.

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Example 3}: Suppose that $f(0) = -3$ and $f'(x) \leq 5$ for all values of $x$. How large can $f(2)$ possibly be?

We are given that $f$ is differentiable - and therefore continuous - everywhere. In particular, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem on the interval $[0,2]$. There exists a number $c$ such that $f(2) -f(0) = f'(c)(2-0)$. So, $f(2)=f(0)+2f'(c)=-3+2f'(c)$.

We are given that $f'(x) \leq5$ for all $x$. So, in particular, we know that $f'(c) \leq5$. Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 2, we have $2f'(c)=10$. So $f(2)=-3+2f'(c)=-3+10=7$. The largest possible value for $f(2)$ is 7.

\vspace{11pt}
\section{Lecture 2 - Taylor Series}

A Taylor Series is a way to represent a function as an infinite sum of terms. In practice, we use a "Taylor Polynomial" (a finite version) to approximate complex functions using simpler polynomial terms. Why is this useful? In computer science and physics, many functions (like $sin(x)$ or $e^x$) are very difficult for a processor to calculate directly. Instead, calculators and computers often use Taylor Series (or related polynomial approximations) to find a value that is "accurate enough" within a certain number of decimal places.

Suppose $f \in C^n[a,b]$, where $C$ is continuous and $n$ is the \# of differentiations, then $f^{n+1}$ exists on $[a,b]$, and $x_0 \in [a,b]$. For every $x\in[a,b]$, there exists a number $\xi(x)$ between $x_0$ and $x$ with

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
    $f(x)=P_n(x)+R_n(x)$
\end{center}

where

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
    $P_n(x)=f(x_0)+f'(x_0)(x-x_0)+\frac{f''(x_0)}{2!}(x-x_0)^2 + ...+\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n$

    $= \sum_{k=0}^n\frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}(x-x_0)^k$
\end{center}

and

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}
    $R_n(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi(x))}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}$
\end{center}
\vspace{11pt}

Here, $P_n(x)$ is called the n-th Taylor polynomial for $f$ about $x_0$, and $R_n(x)$ is called the remainder term (or truncation error) associated with $P_n(x)$. Since the number $\xi(x)$ in the truncation error, $R_n(x)$ depends on the value of $x$ at which the polynomial $P_n(x)$ is being evaluated, it is a function of the variable $x$. However, we should not expect to be able to explicitly determine the function $\xi(x)$. Taylor's Theorem simply ensures that such a function exists and that its value lies between $x$ and $x_0$. In fact, one of the common problems in numerical methods is to try to determine a realistic bound for the value of $f^{(n_+1)}(\xi(x))$ when $x$ is in some specified interval.

The infinite series obtained by taking the limit of $P_n(x)$ as $n\to\infty$ is called the Taylor series for $f$ about $x_0$. In the case $x_0=0$, the Taylor polynomial is often called a Maclaurin polynomial, and the Taylor series is often called a Maclaurin series.

The term truncation error in the Taylor polynomial refers to the error involved in using a truncated, or finite, summation to approximate the sum of an infinite series.

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Example 1}: Let $f(x)=cos(x)$ and $x_0=0$. Determine
\begin{itemize}
    \item The second Taylor polynomial (n=2) for $f$ about $x_0$.
    \item The third Taylor polynomial (n=3) for $f$ about $x_0$.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{11pt}
\textbf{Solution}

\vspace{11pt}
Since $f \in C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$, Taylor's Theorem can be applied to any $n \geq 0$. Also,

\vspace{11pt}
$f'(x)=-sin(x), f''(x)=-cos(x), f'''(x)=sin(x), and f^{4}=cos(x)$.

\vspace{11pt}
so, $f(0)=1, f'(0)=0, f''(0)=-1,f'''(0)=0$.

\vspace{11pt}
\begin{center}

\textbf{(a)}
\vspace{11pt}

For $n=2$ and $x_0=0$, we have:

$cos(x)=f(0)+f'(0)x+\frac{f''(0)}{2!}x^2+\frac{f'''(\xi(x))}{3!}x^3$

$=1-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{1}{6}x^3sin(\xi(x))$, 

where $\xi(x)$ is some (generally unknown) number between 0 and $x$.
